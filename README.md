# Tower Defense Game
A simplified version of Plants vs Zombies 

### Project Overview
The player defends the tower by buying defensive weapons and adding on the tower. 
Initially, there are two weapons: a shotting one and a throwing one. The weapons can be made by gaining the scores, which were earned by hitting the enemies. Once added, the weapons can be upgraded with the credits.
If the weapons are on level 2, weapons shot yellow projectiles. When the projectile hits the doge, it splits into three smaller red balls; If the weapon are on level 3, the weapons shot blue projectiles. When the projectile hits the doge, it splits into three smaller yellow balls and those yellow balls further split into three red balls.
Once the doge reaches the tower, the number of weapon will decreased by one from bottom to the top. 

The aim is to defend the base and kill the boss: if no weapon left and doge reaches the terminal point, game lost; if the big boss (which shows up when the score excesses 1100) is killed, game win.

plus:every time when the weapon is created, the fire cost doubled, but the fire cost cannot exceed 1200; every time when the weapon is upgraded, the upgrade cost doubled, but the upgrade cost cannot exceed 1200.
